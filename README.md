# Vector tiles with tilelive-bridge and Leaflet

This repository contains code demonstrating the rendering of a GeoJSON file using [tilelive-bridge](https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive-bridge) with Mapnik. The output is in vector tile (.pbf, protobuf) format. The server directory contains the server application `app.js`, an intermediate Mapnik compatible stylesheet `map.xml` and the data file `random-points.geojson` containing 5000 randomly distributed points in Germany.

The `viewer` folder contains a small example on how to use the output generated by the server with Leaflet and [Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile](https://github.com/SpatialServer/Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile).

To use it, do the following:
```bash
cd server
npm install
node app.js
```

The server will accept requests on `localhost:9999`. Start the `viewer/index.html` to see the results.
